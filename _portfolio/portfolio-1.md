title: "Applied Statistics"
excerpt: "This course included some python code to learn some about Machine Learning methods and applications using real life and simulated data. This was an group project made in conjuction with Melani Geng, Rodrigo Sillupu and Gonzalo Quiroz."

* **Laboratory 1: FWL demonstration and Some Data Visualization**

Here we first proofed the Frisch Waugh Lovell Theorem. Then, using 1989-1991 CPS,  we estimated an extended version of the Mincer equation and made some data visualization examples to understand the education returns on wages.

* **Laboratory 2: Data Splitting and Lasso Regression basics**

Here we learned the basics of data splitting. By splitting our data we can validate our trained algorith and we can prove if its goodness of fit. In this scropt we also made some data visualization exercises to learn what happens with the fitting when we change the $\alpha$ (penalization parameter) size of Lasso Regressions.
