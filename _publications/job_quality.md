## Abstract

This research seeks to analyze the job quality of interdepartmental migrants in urban areas during 2019 and 2020. Job quality, under the decent work approach, encompasses dimensions of workers' well-being. We construct an index which is based on compliance of  three dimensions of job quality. After constructing the index and finding that job quality deteriorated, we find, using a generalized ordinal logit, that there is no-relation between being migrant and job quality. Nonetheless there are other sociodemographic characteristics that migrants usually share which are linked to the lowest job quality.
