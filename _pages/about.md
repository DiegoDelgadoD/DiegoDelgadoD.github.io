About me

I'm a final-year undergraduate student at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). My main fields of interest are development, education, financial inclusion and data science. Currently I'm also a Research Intern at Innovations for Poverty Action ([IPA](https://www.poverty-action.org/country/peru)) Perú.
